#A practice of 2-to-2 Fixed Priority Arbiter used to multi-core processor

In this paper, they have proposed a fixed priority arbiter scheme which has fast, simple, low power, low cost, easy migration and model.
The design methodologies is as follows:
1)	We first decide the architecture in which we are going to design. Then we plan the processor structure, choice of memory/ cache and peripherals.
2)	Choose the arbiter structure. 
3)	Define the interconnection between the blocks.
4)	Design the functional simulation of the entire system. 
5)	Verify the simulation. 
6)	If the simulation is correct, then the performance is analyzed. If not, processor structure, memory cache and arbiterâ€˜s structure is designed again. 
7)	Then the performance is analyzed. If the performance is good, the design can be implemented or else the whole system has to be redesigned.
